Before solving the questions we will have to look at the following concepts:
What is rand(): rand() is used to generate a series of random numbers. The random number is generated by using an algorithm that gives a series of non-related numbers whenever this function is called. The rand() function is used in C++ to generate random numbers in the range [0, RAND_MAX]

A random seed (or seed state, or just seed) is a number (or vector) used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator. For a seed to be used in a pseudorandom number generator, it does not 
need to be random.

What is the purpose of Srand () and time ()?
srand() Standard Practices
The time() function returns the number of seconds since 00:00 hours, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (i.e. the current unix timestamp). As a result, the value of seed changes with time. So every time we run 
the program, a new set of random numbers is generated.

What is difference between rand () and Srand ()?
The rand() function in C++ is used to generate random numbers; it will generate the same number every time we run the program. In order to seed the rand() function, srand(unsigned int seed) is used. The srand() function sets the initial point for generating the pseudo-random numbers.

By now you have noticed the use of the return statement also called jump statements.
There are two scenarios in which return statements will be used:                  

Method 1. Inside the main function:
return 0: A return 0 means that the program will execute successfully and did what it was intended to do.
return 1: A return 1 means that there is some error while executing the program, and it is not performing what it was intended to do.

Method 2. Inside the user-defined function:
return 0: returning false from a function.
return 1: returning true from a function.

Return 0 indicates that the program implementation is accomplished and that the processor can now be uploaded.
As a result, we must terminate the program ourselves and utilize return 0 to properly halt the execution.

Why Do We Use C Format Specifiers?
Format specifiers in C are used to take inputs and print the output of a type. The symbol we use in every format specifier is %. Format specifiers tell the compiler about the type of data that must be given or input and the type of data that must be printed on the screen.

%d or %i

A decimal integer or signed integer

%c

Signed character

%f

Signed float

%e

A floating-point number

%s

A string or sequence of character

%lf

double

%Lf

Long double

%o

%u

Octal integer

Short unsigned integer

%ld

Long decimal integer

%x

Hexadecimal integer

%p

Print memory address in the hexadecimal form

What does signed vs unsigned mean?
An unsigned contains just zero or positive values, whereas a signed has both positive and negative along with the value zero.

STDLIB.H - is the header of the general purpose standard library of C programming language which includes functions involving memory allocation, process control, conversions and others. It is compatible with C++ and is known as cstdlib in C++. The name "stdlib" stands for "standard library".

PUTCHAR- is a function in the C programming language that writes a single character to the standard output stream, stdout. Its prototype is as follows: e.g int putchar (int character) The character to be printed is fed into the function as an argument, and if the writing is successful, the argument character is returned.

The modulo operator, denoted by %, is an arithmetic operator. The modulo division operator produces the remainder of an integer division.

With this concepts now understood, we can solve Questions in this project.
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

1. The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
The string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
